    <p>Dash is a cute cat who is very fearful! he like pancakes though even though they give him diarrhea. He like to try jumping out the house over the fence to the farm. He sits on the dinner table and acts like a lazy human! </p>
      <p> He doesn't like bugs but he does enjoy eating them and is scared of everything and if a <b><i>ant</i></b> crawls on him and when its windy he runs for home! He also like running!</p>
